Open this "index.html" file in VS Code and tab on "go live" then it will work properly otherwise there is some parts of website which can be stop working, so its recommended to open file in "VS Code" and click on "Go Live".

Do try to open it in Microsoft edge to run whole project properly because its written in only HTML, CSS, JS

for reference do watch the website screen recording video in case website doesn't work properly.
